# Glowing Pong
## Description
Pong is a classic two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. Players control paddles by moving them vertically across the left or right side of the screen, and they compete against an AI or another player. The goal is to score points by hitting a ball past the opponent's paddle. <br>
This project is a simple implementation of the Pong game using C# and Unity. It provides a basic example of game development fundamentals including game loops, collision, detection, sprites and more.
